Teeny Flask App
=====

I was asked to write a little web app for a small organization that could
apply rudimentary password protection to some documents. The minimal needs
of the organization allow a single username and password to be shared by
all users.

I first thought of Django but a database was not desired, so I went for the
simpler option of using Flask. I drew on the following sources.
